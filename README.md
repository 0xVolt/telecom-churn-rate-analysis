## About this Repository
In this analysis, I explore the factors that contribute to customer churn in the telecom industry using various machine learning techniques and models on the [Orange Telecom Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets?select=churn-bigml-80.csv).

Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, I identify patterns and relationships between these features and customer churn. I then train and evaluate various machine learning models to predict customer churn and identify the most important predictors. In addition to the code and results, this repository includes a detailed report outlining the methodology and findings of my analysis.
